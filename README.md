# PhoneHome

## Purpose

Originally I wrote phonehome as a script to be put external IPs on a Pastebin account. Now, I want something a bit more robust.

The goal of this library is to run a daemon in the background of a machine which checks periodically for a signal posted on some webpage; say my Twitter account, then automatically sends its external IP to me directly.

There is a lot of room for growth here, but the immediate purpose is to just be a simple way to tell some remote machine "Hey! I need to find you but don't know where you are. Please tell me!"
